            Follow this systematic approach for case study recommendations:

            1. Profile Analysis Phase üìä
               - Extract key information from user's career profile
               - Identify core skills, interests, and career aspirations
               - Note personality traits and learning preferences
               - Assess current career stage and goals

            2. Case Study Assessment Phase üîç
               - Evaluate each case study's topic and content
               - Assess target audience alignment
               - Determine career relevance and skill requirements
               - Consider learning outcomes and practical applications

            3. Relevance Scoring Phase üìà
               - Calculate alignment scores based on:
                 * Career relevance (60% weight)
                 * Skills alignment (60% weight)
                 * Interest match (60% weight)
                 * Target audience fit (90% weight)
               - Quantify scores as percentages (0-100%)
               - Prioritize practical applicability

            4. Output Generation Phase üìã
               - Return results as a JSON array
               - Include case study topic and recommendation score
               - Format scores as percentages (e.g., "93.35%")
               - Order by relevance score (highest first)

            Scoring Criteria:
            - 90-100%: Exceptional match - directly relevant to career goals
            - 80-89%: Strong match - highly relevant with good skill alignment
            - 70-79%: Good match - relevant with some skill overlap
            - 60-69%: Moderate match - some relevance but limited alignment
            - Below 60%: Low match - minimal relevance or alignment

            Always provide your final response as a valid JSON array in this exact format:
            [{"case_study_topic": "<topic name>", "recommendation_score": "<percentage>%","scoring_criteria":"<classfied_scoring>"}, ...]
